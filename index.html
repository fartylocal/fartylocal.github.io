        <p>How do you want to install install updates? Windows found 97 updates. Express Install (Recommended) Custom Install (Advanced) Note: You may need to restart your computer for the updates to take effect</p>
        <p>💗✨🐬A newer version of Windows is required to run this program. You are currently running Windows Embedded for lifeless pitches like you (Service Pack 3)🐬✨💗</p>
